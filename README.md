# Final Project

## CODE EXPLANATION

#### Hello. The game that we have originally planned on creating this year for our computer science CPT was Bloons Tower Defense 7, an updated, modified, and better version of the Bloons TD series. After stumbling into many obstables and bugs and being unable to overcome them after an ample amount of time, we realized that our intellects are not high enough to produce such a game in so little time. As a result of this, we decided to move on to our backup game: Snake. In this game, the character uses the WASD buttons to move the snake. The snake starts off as one block long, and the snake will continue to grow every time a bug is consumed (Haha, do you get the joke? We used bug because our game is buggy lol.) The player starts off with a score of zero, and the score increases by one every time a bug is consumed by the snake. The score can also be calculated by the length of snake minus one. The objective of this game is to get as high of a score as possible. The game is over as soon as the snake collides with the wall or its body. Once the game is over, the game over screen and user's score will be displayed. Once the game finishes, the user may restart the game without having to exit and rerun the code by simply clicking the space bar. The main menu screen has also been finely crafted by Xavier and David. In the main menu screen, the title "Snake" is displayed and the controls are shown to the users so they will know how to play the game instantly. In this game, we have also mastered a technique that allows the background to change colour. In our game, the background changes colour every time a bug is consumed by the snake.
